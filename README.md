## My experience

Over time i realized how much it has (what i lacked), i take into account that i lack information on actors, cast, etc. Bring information it takes a long time and it is kind of monotonous. Im happy with the result. I hope you too.

Also clarified that this's my first proyect using the full stack. I hope not to make them die seeing the structure. sorry!
